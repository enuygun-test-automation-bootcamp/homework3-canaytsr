Two different approaches were considered in this Project.
First, the driver type is selected and the type of data requested from the class is analyzed and adjustments are made.

In the second approach, Firefox and Chrome Drivers inherit a single driver class.
With this method, it allows to collect common features under Driver and to define different features in its own class.
